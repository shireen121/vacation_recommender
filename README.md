# Vacation Recommendation Engine  
  
In this project, I created a recommendation engine for vacation spots and activities across the globe based on user interests using Tripadvisor reviews as a proxy for user experiences.  
  
The key steps are as follows:  
Step 1: Scrape reviews from TripAdvisor (See scrapy_atl_tripadvisor.py for sample of scrapy code)  
Step 2: Dimensionality reduction utilizing LDA topic modeling with reviews (See main_workbook.ipynb for Steps 2-4)  
Step 3: Calculate similarities between activities based on topic distribution of reviews  
Step 4: Create Recommendation Engine  
Step 5: Build Flask App (To be provided - demo of app available in presentation slides)
